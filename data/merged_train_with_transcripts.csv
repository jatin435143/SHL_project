It's harsh and it's best to like three others with respect and just be an all around good person. The biggest challenge is actually having a moral and ethical values and staying with them to be able to stick to them in general, no matter how hard things can actually get and not be a hypocrite. But I think I would love to be able to pass this down to my son, and that would be actually my biggest challenge to make him understand why I am doing this.

It's exciting for me as well, but just seeing his reaction lights up my entire world. It is the best feeling, and I can't get enough of it."

I first travelled there in 2010 and it was after a work conference in Las Vegas that was really hectic and it felt really magical because I got on a really small plane and the flight was really short and the airport as soon as we landed the airport was stunning, beautiful architecture or open air. Absolutely magical. My favourite restaurant there is Melbourne's. It was a hangout, favourite hangout of the rep pack and especially Frank Sinatra. He had his wedding there and stage of the honeymoon at the end of the store as well. I actually really liked being there in the middle of summer. It was absolutely stunning."

That's in the way of making repairs, so things like holes in fabrics and loss buttons and zips which don't work anymore, it's just fixing that up. And for the times it's just completely changing the design of that particular clothing into something else. Generally it doesn't require too much, I guess, tools to do this. A simple needle and thread is fine, most of the time, for more complex things like turning a particular clothing into a different design that does require a sewing machine. A lot of the times I'm doing this by myself, sometimes my sister and I will do it together, we'll do things like fix types because we love accessories."

There is the sound of basketballs on the swing. The squeak of swings and the occasional shout of joy. The playground is like a cafe colorosis with slides, sea sauce and all scorched squads. It's a hub of energy and fun with friendships or made on memories upgraded. So each people that the sketches unique to their own time could never be totally different. Exactly. This area is completely teased. We didn't feel a single Erst into the first part before the first one comes. It's getting late and the story continues."
